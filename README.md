# TeraSort on Hadoop/Spark

The goal of this programming assignment is to enable us to gain experience programming with:
•	Amazon Web Services, specifically the EC2 cloud (http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/)
•	The Hadoop framework (http://hadoop.apache.org/)
•	The Spark framework (http://spark.apache.org/)
Four Different platforms are used to evaluate the performance of the TeraSort which is as follows:
•	Java Shared Memory [Java 1.8]
•	Hadoop [2.7.2]
•	Apache Spark [1.6.0]
The performance of the application will be carried on the Amazon AWS in a Linux environment
